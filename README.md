[At the Bukkit forums, of course!][plugin]

wate what dose this do
======================
The original generator from codename_B made something that looks like this:  
![An example world generated using codename_B's generator](http://img7.imagebanana.com/img/peacymda/output.png)

This is an extension of codename_B's generator that makes things like pools and ruins
(and more!) appear in the rather empty rooms made by the original project.

What does each class do?
========================
* [com.ubempire.dungeon.DungeonPlugin](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/com/ubempire/dungeon/DungeonPlugin.java) allows this to be used as a plugin that generates a world named "dungeon", or to create additional worlds by the method in [codename_B's tutorial](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/basic-creating-custom-world-generators.24569/).
* [com.ubempire.dungeon.DungeonGenerator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/com/ubempire/dungeon/DungeonGenerator.java) is the heart of the generator. It contains a list of populators in the order they should be run, in addition to making the walls and floor.
* [com.ubempire.dungeon.DungeonPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/com/ubempire/dungeon/DungeonPopulator.java) is the first populator run after the generator. It prevents dungeon rooms from having no neighbors.
* [net.llamaslayers.minecraft.banana.populators.PoolPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/net/llamaslayers/minecraft/banana/populators/PoolPopulator.java) runs next, making pools of water or lava (but not close to the spawn) in about 20% of chunks.
* [net.llamaslayers.minecraft.banana.populators.ExplosionPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/net/llamaslayers/minecraft/banana/populators/ExplosionPopulator.java) runs after PoolPopulator, making the map look more ancient by making small (half of TNT's power, 37.5%), medium (TNT's power, 12.5%), or large (9-19 activated TNT spawned in the middle of the room, 0.25%) explosions.
* [net.llamaslayers.minecraft.banana.populators.RuinsPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/net/llamaslayers/minecraft/banana/populators/RuinsPopulator.java) is the next to run after ExplosionPopulator, and the first populator I programmed. It generates ruins by picking a location and a height, then moving in one or two directions while reducing the height. The end result is something that looks like a crumbling wall.
* [net.llamaslayers.minecraft.banana.populators.LanternPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/net/llamaslayers/minecraft/banana/populators/LanternPopulator.java) who wouldn't want Jack-O-Lanterns in the walls of their dungeon?
* [net.llamaslayers.minecraft.banana.populators.ChestPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/net/llamaslayers/minecraft/banana/populators/ChestPopulator.java) adds an incentive for exploring dungeons - chests that occur in about 1 out of 10 rooms, filled with all kinds of helpful exploration items.
* [net.llamaslayers.minecraft.banana.populators.WebPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/net/llamaslayers/minecraft/banana/populators/WebPopulator.java) adds some abandoned spider webs to the dungeon for extra ambiance.
* [net.llamaslayers.minecraft.banana.populators.TorchPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/net/llamaslayers/minecraft/banana/populators/TorchPopulator.java) runs after RuinsPopulator, adding up to 3 torches in a chunk at random locations where air touches a surface.
* [net.llamaslayers.minecraft.banana.populators.CeilingPopulator](https://github.com/Nightgunner5/BananaMaze/blob/master/src/net/llamaslayers/minecraft/banana/populators/CeilingPopulator.java) runs last. It generates a ceiling at the top of the dungeon with holes generated by simplex noise.

How to contribute
=================
If you know Java and are comfortable working with Bukkit's BlockPopulator class,
fork this repository, add your changes, and submit a pull request.

If you don't know Java or you don't want to code something, but you have an idea,
post it at the [forum topic][topic] so someone can implement your idea.

If your idea or code is in this project and your name is not in plugin.yml, make
a comment somewhere so we can fix that.
