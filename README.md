wate what dose this do
======================
The original project from codename_B made something that looks like this:  
![An example world generated using this project](http://img7.imagebanana.com/img/peacymda/output.png)

This is an extension of codename_B's project that makes things like pools and ruins
(and more!) appear in the rather empty rooms made by the original project.

How to contribute
=================
If you know Java and are comfortable working with Bukkit's BlockPopulator class,
fork this repository, add your changes, and submit a pull request.

If you don't know Java or you don't want to code something, but you have an idea,
post it at the [forum topic][topic] so someone can implement your idea.

If your idea or code is in this project and your name is not in plugin.yml, make
a comment somewhere so we can fix that.
